# SIGN-AI: An AI Assistant for Sign Language

## Project Overview

SIGN-AI is a unified framework designed to enable high-fidelity sign language synthesis from text, voice, and video inputs. Its primary goal is to bridge accessibility gaps for over 70 million deaf individuals worldwide by providing real-time, accurate sign language translation for media, education, and professional communication.

## Motivation

- **Accessibility Barriers:**  
  - 83% of STEM education materials are not accessible in sign language.
  - Only 4.7% of online content includes sign interpretation.
  - Deaf individuals face 3Ã— higher unemployment rates than hearing peers.
  
## Future Directions

- Low-latency video-to-video sign language conversion
- Integration of an intelligent AI Assistant for enhanced accessibility

---

**SIGN-AI stands as a transformative solution for accessibility, education, and social inclusion, leveraging advanced AI to empower the global deaf community.**
