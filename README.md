# SIGN-AI – An AI Assistant For Sign Language

Access to education, media, and professional opportunities should be universal, yet poeple with special needs face significant barriers every day. With **SIGN-AI**, i'm creating direct, instant communication to make it possible for poeple with special needs to engage with the world through real-time sign language translation from text, voice, or video.

**SIGN-AI** introduces an innovative approach to communication, transforming content into clear, accurate sign language translations as it happens. This technology enables students to follow complex STEM lessons, professionals to participate fully in live meetings, and families to share media experiences—all with seamless accessibility.

Your expertise and enthusiasm can help shape a more inclusive technology , be a part of SIGN-AI!
