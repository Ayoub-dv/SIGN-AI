# SIGN-AI: High-Fidelity Real-Time Sign Language Synthesis

## Project Overview

SIGN-AI is a unified framework designed to enable high-fidelity sign language synthesis from text, voice, and video inputs. Its primary goal is to bridge accessibility gaps for over 70 million deaf individuals worldwide by providing real-time, accurate sign language translation for media, education, and professional communication.

## Motivation

- **Accessibility Barriers:**  
  - 83% of STEM education materials are not accessible in sign language.
  - Only 4.7% of online content includes sign interpretation.
  - Deaf individuals face 3× higher unemployment rates than hearing peers.

## Core Contributions

SIGN-AI introduces two novel algorithmic approaches:

### 1. **Text/Image-Driven Synthesis (Algorithm 1)**
- **Pipeline:** Converts multimodal inputs to text, generates sign images using Vision Transformers (SGN-IMG dataset), animates frames via optical flow prediction (0.5–2s clips), and sequences with LSTM models.
- **Advantages:**  
  - CPU-feasible (computationally efficient)
  - Explicit, fine-grained sign control
  - 70% reduction in computational resources vs. state-of-the-art

### 2. **End-to-End Video Synthesis (Algorithm 2)**
- **Pipeline:** Uses diffusion models (SGN-VID dataset) to directly translate text to motion vectors, producing 1–3s sign language video segments with attention-based fusion.
- **Advantages:**  
  - Superior motion fidelity via learned co-articulation
  - Achieves 92% motion naturalness benchmark

## Projected Impact

- **Education:** 45% faster STEM concept acquisition, 30% increase in deaf graduates by 2035
- **Economy:** $17B estimated annual productivity gains
- **Society:** Real-time translation for streaming media, educational, and professional platforms

## Future Directions

- Low-latency video-to-video sign language conversion
- Integration of an intelligent AI Assistant for enhanced accessibility

**SIGN-AI stands as a transformative solution for accessibility, education, and social inclusion, leveraging advanced AI to empower the global deaf community.**
